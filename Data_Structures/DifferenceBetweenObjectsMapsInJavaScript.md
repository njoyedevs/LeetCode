In JavaScript, there are three common data structures that are often used for similar purposes: Objects, Maps, and Hash Maps. Let's discuss the differences between them:

1. Objects:
 * Objects in JavaScript are a collection of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings, and the values can be any data type.
 * Objects are the most basic and fundamental data structure in JavaScript, and they can be used as a simple way to store and access key-value pairs.
 * One limitation of using objects as a hash map is that the keys are always converted to strings, even if they are numbers or other data types.
 * Objects do not maintain any insertion order for their keys, so iterating over the keys may not follow the order in which they were added.
2. Maps:
 * Maps are a built-in data structure introduced in ES6 that store key-value pairs.
 * Unlike objects, Maps can have keys of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, or even functions.
 * Maps maintain the order of keys based on the order in which they were added, so iterating over the keys will follow the order of insertion.
 * Maps have built-in methods like get, set, has, delete, and more, which provide a clear and easy-to-use API for working with key-value pairs.
 * Maps generally perform better than objects for large datasets and when keys are not just strings.
3. Hash Maps:
 * "Hash Map" is a more general term referring to a data structure that stores key-value pairs, with efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
 * In JavaScript, there is no built-in "Hash Map" data structure, but you can implement a Hash Map using an Object or a Map, depending on your needs.
 * When we mention "Hash Map" in the context of JavaScript, it usually refers to using an Object or a Map as a hash map, depending on the specific requirements.

In summary, Objects are the most basic key-value storage in JavaScript but have limitations with non-string keys and key ordering. Maps offer more features and flexibility, with support for any data type as keys and maintaining key insertion order. Hash Maps are a general term for a key-value storage data structure, and in JavaScript, they are typically implemented using Objects or Maps, depending on the use case.
